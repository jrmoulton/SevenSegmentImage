# Seven Segment Image
Verilog implementation for a 7 segment display on a basys3 board

This project implements several forms of verilog code in order to generate numbers 1-9 and A-F on a seven segment display. 
The organization in vivado is likely terrible but in a few moments the project structure can be changed so that the project is implemented with either heirarachal or with combinational code.
